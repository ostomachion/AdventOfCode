Fix some parsing bugs combining quantifiers and captures and maybe parens?

Parse straight to IEnumerable<T>. Use some capture name for items? :Items

Specify input/output side of backreference?
Allow backreferences in transforms
Nested transforms??>

Call external functions/transforms

Numeric:
	Capture quantifier counts
	Numeric operators
	Use numeric captures as quantifiers
	Shorthand for repeated quantifier without captures <foo>*` = (<foo>:bar @bar*)?

String:
	Shift by character class: a~\l => b, a~^3\l => c, a^-1\l => z
	

Lookahead, positive and negative

Captures from subexpressions?
